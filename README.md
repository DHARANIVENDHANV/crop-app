# Crop Disease Detector

This repository contains a Streamlit web application for detecting crop diseases using a pre-trained convolutional neural network model built with PyTorch. Users can upload images of crop leaves, and the app will classify the crop type and identify any potential diseases.

## Requirements

To run this app, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `streamlit`
- `PIL` (Pillow)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision streamlit pillow
